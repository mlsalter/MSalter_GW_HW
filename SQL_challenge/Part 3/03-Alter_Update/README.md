# Alter vs. Update


### Part 1

* Explain the difference between `alter` and `update` in SQL statements.

  The differences between `alter` and `update` comes down to changes to the structure of the table and changes to the data. The `alter` statement is used to make changes to the structure of a table, so add, drop, or modify columns. It can also add and drop different constraints on a table. While the `update` statement is used to make changes to the data/content/records of the table. It does not change the structure of a table.

### Part 2

* You are given the following table:

* Add a column named `annual_salary` to the table.
